# Forbes 2000 time-dependent correlation network analysis of opening stock market values
In this project, we study the correlation graph between stock value time series of top-performing public companies. Analysis of such a graph could prove to be a highly beneficial endeavor in the context of financial forecasting, since if we spot a reasonably stable correlation trend between some assets, we could make smart investment choices related to one of assets based on what we currently know about another.
